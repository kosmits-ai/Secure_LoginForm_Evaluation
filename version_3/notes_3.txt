In this version, we introduce sessions and cookies to highlight the distinction between authentication and authorization. 
Authentication verifies a user’s identity during login, while authorization determines what actions or resources an authenticated user is allowed to access.

After successful authentication, the server creates a session representing the authenticated user.
A session cookie is stored in the user’s browser and automatically sent with each request. This allows the server to identify the user and retrieve trusted session data.
Authorization decisions are then enforced server-side by checking session attributes, such as the user’s identity, before granting access to protected resources.

To demonstrate Broken Access Control (OWASP A01), we intentionally implemented a vulnerable endpoint that does not validate session state.
As a result, both authenticated and unauthenticated users can access the vulnerable dashboard directly via its URL.
In contrast, a secure endpoint properly enforces authorization checks and restricts access to authenticated users only.

A logout endpoint is also implemented to invalidate the session by clearing server-side session data.
Although the session cookie may still exist in the browser, it no longer represents an authenticated state.
