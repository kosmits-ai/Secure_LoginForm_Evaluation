In this version, we introduce the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS is a client-side vulnerability that allows malicious actors to inject executable code into a web application, which is then executed in the victim’s browser.

There are multiple types of XSS vulnerabilities. In this implementation, we demonstrate a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. DOM XSS occurs entirely on the client side, where malicious input is processed and rendered by frontend JavaScript logic without the server ever seeing the injected payload.

Root Cause

The vulnerability arises because user-controlled input is inserted into the DOM using innerHTML, which causes the browser to interpret the input as HTML rather than plain text. As a result, any markup or script-like content provided by the user is parsed and rendered by the browser.

This allows malicious users to inject HTML elements or JavaScript code into the page, effectively modifying the DOM structure and behavior of the application.

Impact

Through XSS, an attacker can:

Inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser

Modify the page layout or content

Interact with the application as the victim user

In a session-based application, this impact is significantly amplified. Injected scripts execute in the context of the authenticated user, allowing attackers to abuse the user’s privileges and perform actions on their behalf.

Resolution

The vulnerability is resolved by replacing innerHTML with textContent when rendering user input:

innerHTML interprets input as HTML (unsafe)

textContent treats input strictly as data (safe)

This ensures that user-supplied input is rendered as plain text and cannot be executed by the browser.

Relation to Other Injection Vulnerabilities

Both XSS and SQL injection are caused by improper handling of untrusted input, where user-supplied data is processed as executable code instead of being treated as data.

However, they occur at different layers:

SQL Injection targets the backend database by injecting SQL logic

XSS targets the browser by injecting HTML or JavaScript

Although they share a common root cause, they represent distinct attack vectors with different execution environments and impacts.

In conclusion, XSS occurs when untrusted input is rendered as executable code in the browser rather than being treated as data.
